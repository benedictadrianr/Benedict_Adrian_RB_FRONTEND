!app can only be run when all dependencies have been installed on the device!
if haven't consider installing:
npm i cors
npm i react-router-dom
npm i dotenv
npm i express
npm i mongoose

direct the terminal to backend folder with ("cd ./backend/") and run ("yarn dev") to start the backend server
open another terminal to frontend folder with ("cd ./frontend/") and run ("yarn dev") and from the terminal results will be given the link to open the app through localhost
